# Make Logo Great Again

This project was implemented with Angular 8.

The user should pick a card from the Pickup Cards a​rea and try to put it into **correct slot** within the Z​oovu Logo area by drag and drop.

For example: 

If there is a 'Z' symbol in Find this card area, user should guess where is that symbol in Pickup Cards area and moved the card into first slot, because 'Z' is at the first position in Zoovu Logo.
