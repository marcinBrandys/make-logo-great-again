# Make Logo Great Again

This project was implemented with Angular 8.

The user should pick a card from the Pickup Cards a​rea and try to put it into **correct slot** within the Z​oovu Logo area by drag and drop.

For example: 

If there is a 'Z' symbol in Pickup Cards area, user should guess where is that symbol and moved the card into first slot, because 'Z' is at the first position in Zoovu Logo.
